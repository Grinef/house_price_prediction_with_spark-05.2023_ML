In the project, you need to train a linear regression model on housing data in California in 1990.
You have already worked with this dataset in the fourth topic of the course.

The dataset columns contain the following data:
- longitude: longitude coordinate
- latitude: latitude coordinate
- housing_median_age: median age of the houses in the area
- total_rooms: total number of rooms in the houses in the area
- total_bedrooms: total number of bedrooms in the houses in the area
- population: total number of people residing in the area
- households: total number of households in the area
- median_income: median income of the residents in the area
- median_house_value: median house value in the area
- ocean_proximity: proximity to the ocean

Based on the data, you need to predict the median house value in the area (median_house_value). 
Train the model and make predictions on the test set. To evaluate the model's quality, use the RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics.
